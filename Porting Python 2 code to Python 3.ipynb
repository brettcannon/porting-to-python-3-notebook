Update your code to drop support for Python 2.5 or older (supporting only Python 2.7 is ideal)\n2. Make sure you have good test coverage ([coverage.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage) can help; `pip install coverage`)\n3. Learn the differences between Python 2 & 3\n4. Use [Modernize](http://python-modernize.readthedocs.org/en/latest) or [Futurize](http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html) to update your code (`pip install modernize` or `pip install future`, respectively)\n5. Use [Pylint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint) to help make sure you don't regress on your Python 3 support (if only supporting Python 2.7/3.4 or newer; `pip install pylint`)\n6. Use [caniusepython3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caniusepython3) to find out which of your dependencies are blocking your use of Python 3 (`pip install caniusepython3`)\n7. Once your dependencies are no longer blocking you, use continuous integration to make sure you stay compatible with Python 2 & 3 ([tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox) can help test against multiple versions of Python; `pip install tox`)\n\nIf you are dropping support for Python 2 entirely, then after you learn the differences between Python 2 & 3 you can run [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) over your code and skip the rest of the steps outlined above.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"source": "# Details\n\nA key point about supporting Python 2 & 3 simultaneously is that you can start **today**! Even if your dependencies are not supporting Python 3 yet that does not mean you can't modernize your code **now** to support Python 3. Most changes required to support Python 3 lead to cleaner code using newer practices even in Python 2.\n\nAnother key point is that modernizing your Python 2 code to also support Python 3 is largely automated for you. While you might have to make some API decisions thanks to Python 3 clarifying text data versus binary data, the lower-level work is now mostly done for you and thus can at least benefit from the automated changes immediately.\n\nKeep those key points in mind while you read on about the details of porting your code to support Python 2 & 3 simultaneously.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Drop support for Python 2.5 and older (at least)\n\nWhile you can make Python 2.5 work with Python 3, it is much easier if you only have to work with Python 2.6 or newer (and easier still if you only have to work with Python 2.7). If dropping Python 2.5 is not an option then the six project can help you support Python 2.5 & 3 simultaneously (`pip install six`). Do realize, though, that nearly all the projects listed in this HOWTO will not be available to you.\n\nIf you are able to only support Python 2.6 or newer, then the required changes to your code should continue to look and feel like idiomatic Python code. At worst you will have to use a function instead of a method in some instances or have to import a function instead of using a built-in one, but otherwise the overall transformation should not feel foreign to you.\n\nBut please aim for Python 2.7. Bugfixes for that version of Python will continue until 2020 while Python 2.6 is no longer supported. There are also some tools mentioned in this HOWTO which do not support Python 2.6 (e.g., [Pylint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint)), and this will become more commonplace as time goes on.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Make sure you specify the proper version support in your `setup.py` file\n\nIn your `setup.py` file you should have the proper [trove classifier](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers) specifying what versions of Python you support.

A good rule of thumb is that if you want to be confident enough in your test suite that any failures that appear after having tools rewrite your code are actual bugs in the tools and not in your code. If you want a number to aim for, try to get over 80% coverage (and don't feel bad if you can't easily get past 90%).

But to fully understand how your code is going to change and what you want to look out for while you code, you will want to learn what changes Python 3 makes in terms of Python 2. Typically the two best ways of doing that is reading the [What's New](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html) doc for each release of Python 3 and the [Porting to Python 3](http://python3porting.com/) book (which is free online). There is also a handy [cheat sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html) from the Python-Future project.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Update your code\n\nOnce you feel like you know what is different in Python 3 compared to Python 2, it's time to update your code! You have a choice between two tools in porting your code automatically: [Modernize](http://python-modernize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [Futurize](http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html). Which tool you choose will depend on how much like Python 3 you want your code to be. Futurize does its best to make Python 3 idioms and practices exist in Python 2, e.g. backporting the `bytes` type from Python 3 so that you have semantic parity between the major versions of Python. Modernize, on the other hand, is more conservative and targets a Python 2/3 subset of Python, relying on six to help provide compatibility.\n\nRegardless of which tool you choose, they will update your code to run under Python 3 while staying compatible with the version of Python 2 you started with. Depending on how conservative you want to be, you may want to run the tool over your test suite first and visually inspect the diff to make sure the transformation is accurate. After you have transformed your test suite and verified that all the tests still pass as expected, then you can transform your application code knowing that any tests which fail is a translation failure.\n\nUnfortunately the tools can't automate everything to make your code work under Python 3 and so there are a handful of things you will need to update manually to get full Python 3 support (which of these steps are necessary vary between the tools). Read the documentation for the tool you choose to use to see what it fixes by default and what it can do optionally to know what will (not) be fixed for you and what you may have to fix on your own (e.g. using `io.open()` over the built-in `open()` function is off by default in Modernize).

Unfortunately this confluence of two different concepts could lead to brittle code which sometimes worked for either kind of data, sometimes not. It also could lead to confusing APIs if people didn't explicitly state that something that accepted `str` accepted either text or binary data instead of one specific type. This complicated the situation especially for anyone supporting multiple languages as APIs wouldn't bother explicitly supporting `unicode` when they claimed text data support.\n\nTo make the distinction between text and binary data clearer and more pronounced, Python 3 did what most languages created during the age of the internet have done and made text and binary data distinct types that cannot blindly be mixed together (Python predates widespread access to the internet thanks to its development starting in December 1989). For any code that only deals with text or only binary data, this separation doesn't pose an issue. But for code that has to deal with both, it does mean you might have to now care about when you are using text compared to binary data, which is why this cannot be entirely automated.\n\nTo start, you will need to decide which APIs take text and which take binary (it is **highly** recommended you don't design APIs that can take both due to the difficulty of keeping the code working; as stated earlier it is difficult to do well). In Python 2 this means making sure the APIs that take text can work with `unicode` in Python 2 and those that work with binary data work with the `bytes` type from Python 3 and thus a subset of `str` in Python 2 (which the `bytes` type in Python 2 is an alias for `str`). Usually the biggest issue is realizing which methods exist for which types in Python 2 & 3 simultaneously (for text that's `unicode` in Python 2 and `str` in Python 3, for binary that's `str`/`bytes` in Python 2 and `bytes` in Python 3). The following cell shows the unique methods of each data type between Python 2 versus Python 3 as well as what is unique regardless of version (e.g., the `decode()` method is usable on the equivalent binary data type in either Python 2 or 3, but it can't be used by the text data type consistently between Python 2 and 3 because `str` in Python 3 doesn't have the method).", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"execution_count": 132, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import ast\n\n\ndef output_to_set(output):\n    \"\"\"Convert captured shell output to a frozenset.\"\"\"\n    return frozenset(ast.literal_eval(output[0]))\n\n\ndef pprint_set(set_, *, indent):\n    \"\"\"Print each item in a set on its own line with a specified indentation.\"\"\"\n    for item in sorted(set_):\n        if item.startswith('_') and not item.startswith('__'):\n            continue\n        print(' ' * indent + item)\n\n\npy2_text_methods_output = !python2 -c \"print dir(str)\"\npy2_text_unicode_methods_output = !python2 -c \"print dir(unicode)\"\npy2_binary_methods_output = !python2 -c \"print dir(bytes)\"\npy3_text_methods_output = !python3 -c \"print(dir(str))\"\npy3_binary_methods_output = !python3 -c \"print(dir(bytes))\"\n\npy2_text_methods = output_to_set(py2_text_methods_output)\npy2_text_unicode_methods = output_to_set(py2_text_methods_output)\npy2_binary_methods = output_to_set(py2_binary_methods_output)\npy3_text_methods = output_to_set(py3_text_methods_output)\npy3_binary_methods = output_to_set(py3_binary_methods_output)\n\nprint(\"Methods unique to Python 2 (i.e., not available in Python 3 on the equivalent type):\")\nprint('   Text type (as str from Python 2):')\npprint_set(py2_text_methods.difference(py3_text_methods), indent=8)\nprint('   Text type (as unicode from Python 2):')\npprint_set(py2_text_unicode_methods.difference(py3_text_methods), indent=8)\nprint('   Binary type:')\npprint_set(py2_binary_methods.difference(py3_binary_methods), indent=8)\n\ncommon_text_methods = py2_text_methods.intersection(py3_text_methods)\ncommon_binary_methods = py2_binary_methods.intersection(py3_binary_methods)\n\nprint(\"Methods unique to a type regardless of Python version (i.e., don't use on the wrong type in Python 2):\")\nprint('    Text type:')\npprint_set(common_text_methods.difference(common_binary_methods), indent=8)\nprint('    Binary type:')\npprint_set(common_binary_methods.difference(common_text_methods), indent=8)", "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "name": "stdout", "text": "Methods unique to Python 2 (i.e., not available in Python 3 on the equivalent type):\n   Text type (as str from Python 2):\n        __getslice__\n        decode\n   Text type (as unicode from Python 2):\n        __getslice__\n        decode\n   Binary type:\n        __getslice__\n        __mod__\n        __rmod__\n        encode\n        format\nMethods unique to a type regardless of Python version (i.e., don't use on the wrong type in Python 2):\n    Text type:\n        __mod__\n        __rmod__\n        encode\n        format\n    Binary type:\n        decode\n"}], "metadata": {"collapsed": false}}, {"source": "Making the distinction easier to handle can be accomplished by encoding and decoding between binary data and text at the edge of your code.

Your testing will also be set up so that you don't accidentally break Python 2 or 3 compatibility regardless of which version you typically run your tests under while developing.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "# Dropping Python 2 support completely\n\n you are able to fully drop support for Python 2, then the steps required to transition to Python 3 simplify greatly.\n1. Update your code to only support Python 2.7\n2. Make sure you have good test coverage ([coverage.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage) can help)\n3. Learn the differences between Python 2 & 3\n4. Use [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) to rewrite your code to run only under Python 3\n\nAfter this your code will be fully Python 3 compliant but in a way that is not supported by Python 2. You should also update the classifiers in your `setup.py` to contain `Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only`.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "nbformat": 4, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.4.3", "name": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}}
