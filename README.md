Purpose of this repository
==========================
This repository hosts a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook version of the official
[Python 2/3 porting HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html). The idea is
that by having the HOWTO in a notebook it allows one to play with the code examples while
reading the document.
